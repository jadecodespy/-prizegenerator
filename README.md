## Brief 
In this project, the brief states to create an application that has four servers, allowing the user to generate an output based on a set of predefined rules. To complete this project a full expansion of tasks and tools were used to meet the project goal. The MVP requirements are below:

Requirments:
- An Asana board (or equivalent Kanban board tech) with full expansion on tasks needed to complete the project.
- This could also provide a record of any issues or risks that you faced creating your project.
- An Application fully integrated using the Feature-Branch model into a Version Control System which will subsequently be built through a CI server and deployed to a cloud-based virtual machine.
- If a change is made to a code base, then Webhooks should be used so that Jenkins recreates and redeploys the changed application
- The project must follow the Service-oriented architecture that has been asked for.
- The project must be deployed using containerisation and an orchestration tool.
- As part of the project, you need to create an Ansible Playbook that will provision the environment that your application needs to run.
- The project must make use of a reverse proxy to make your application accessible to the user.
